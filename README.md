# Self Service Portal - Password Reset


Self service password management functionality include:

- Allow Users to change passwords when their Active Directory password has expired
- Allow Users to change their own Active Directory password
- Allow Users to regain access to their Active Directory account when the password is not working
- Allow Users to unlock their Active Directory account when it is blocked


The proposed solution is offer a self-service portal using which users can perform above operations. The portal will allow users to enrol their personal email or phone number against their AD account. When AD credentials expire or donâ€™t work, the user would be able to login to the portal with his personal email or phone number to recover their AD account access by reseting the password and/or unlock the account. 

The portal would be configured as a standard Auth0 client with Active Directory and Passwordless connections enabled. The user must login with their AD credentials to enrol their personal email/phone as secondary credentials, which is done using Passwordless sign up process. 

Upon successful passwordless sign up, the portal API links passwordless account as a secondary identity of the AD account. 

After successful linking, the user can log into the portal using his secondary passwordless identity and then regain access to AD account. 

The portal (api) uses following Auth0 endpoints to change or reset password. The PRs are labelled on the diagram below.
